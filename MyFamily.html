<h3>When I look at these photos, I remember the time when it was just me, Mama, and Papa. Life was happy and simple. We laughed, played, and took many pictures together. Then things changed. The youngest did not feel Papaâ€™s love the same way we did. He was still a baby when everything happened. Sometimes I feel sad about it, but I know Papa loved us all. Now, when I see these photos, I feel thankful. Thankful for the moments we had, thankful for Mama who stayed strong, and thankful that love is still in our hearts.</h3>
